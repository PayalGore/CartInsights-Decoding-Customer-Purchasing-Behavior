**CartInsights** is a data-driven project that uncovers the secrets behind customer purchasing behavior. By analyzing **3 million grocery orders** from **200,000 Instacart users**, this project provides actionable insights to optimize product recommendations, improve inventory management, and enhance customer segmentation.

---

## üöÄ **Project Overview**
The goal of **CartInsights** is to decode customer purchasing patterns and provide actionable insights for businesses. Using **transactional data**, this project applies **data science techniques** to:
- Identify **frequently bought-together products**.
- Segment customers based on their **buying habits**.
- Predict **future purchases** using machine learning models.

---

## üìÇ **Dataset**
The dataset includes:
- **order_products_prior.csv**: Prior orders of users.
- **orders.csv**: Order metadata.
- **products.csv**: Product details.
- **aisles.csv**: Aisle details.
- **departments.csv**: Department details.

---

## üîç **Key Insights**
### **1. Popular Products and Aisles**
- Identified the **most popular aisles and products** (e.g., fresh fruits, organic items).
- Discovered that **organic products** have a higher reorder percentage, suggesting a growing demand.

</p>

### **2. Customer Segmentation**
- Segmented customers into **5 distinct groups** using **K-Means clustering**:
  - **Fresh Veggie Lovers**: Customers who primarily buy fresh vegetables.
  - **Organic Enthusiasts**: Customers who prefer organic products.
  - **Frequent Shoppers**: Customers who buy a wide variety of products.
  - **Water Lovers**: Customers who frequently purchase sparkling water.
  - **Packaged Produce Buyers**: Customers who prefer packaged fruits and vegetables.

</p>

### **3. Market Basket Analysis**
- Applied **association rule mining** to identify **28 product pairs** with high lift (e.g., limes and large lemons).
- Provided recommendations for **cross-selling** and **store layout optimization**.

| Product A  | Product B | Lift |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---- |
| Limes  | Large Lemons  | 3 |
| Organic Strawberries | Organic Raspberries | 2.21 |
| Organic Avocado | Large Lemon | 2.12 |
| Organic Strawberries | Organic Blueberries | 2.11 |
| Organic Hass Avocado | Organic Raspberries | 2.08 |
| Banana | Organic Fuji Apple | 1.88 |
| Bag of Organic Bananas | Organic Raspberries | 1.83 |
| Organic Hass Avocado | Bag of Organic Bananas | 1.81 |
| Honeycrisp Apple | Banana | 1.77 |
| Organic Avocado | Organic Baby Spinach | 1.70 |

### **4. Predictive Modeling**
- Built **XGBoost** and **Neural Network** models to predict product reorders, achieving an **AUC-ROC score of 0.85**.
- Extracted **key features** such as product popularity, customer behavior, and aisle/department trends.
